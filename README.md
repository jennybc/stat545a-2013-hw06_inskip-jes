I have tried to make this example as close as possible to my own lab workflow. 
We combine a number of different physiological signals from different pieces of equipment into one proprietary software
program (LabChart).  I then export as a .csv file after testing.  I have one .csv file for each subject that we test.  


Instructions for use: 

Download into an empty directory:

* Input data: 

* Scripts: 01_importingETFDataFiles.R

* Makefile-like script: Makefile.R


Open R and start a fresh RStudio session:

* Set working directory to location where files have been downloaded

    Open makeFile.R, and click on "Source"
